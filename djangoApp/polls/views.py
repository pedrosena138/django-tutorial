# The code for our vote() view does have a small problem.
# It first gets the selected_choice object from the database, then computes the new value of votes, and then saves it back to the database.
# If two users of your website try to vote at exactly the same time, this might go wrong: The same value, letâ€™s say 42, will be retrieved for votes.
# Then, for both users the new value of 43 is computed and saved, but 44 would be the expected value.

# This is called a race condition. If you are interested, you can read Avoiding race conditions using F() to learn how you can solve this issue.
